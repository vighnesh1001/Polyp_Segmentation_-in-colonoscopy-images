# Polyp Segmentation in Colonoscopy Images

![Polyp Segmentation Example](https://via.placeholder.com/800x250)

## Project Overview

This repository contains an implementation of polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images using deep learning techniques. The project aims to improve colorectal cancer screening by automatically identifying and segmenting polyps from colonoscopy images.

## U-Net Architecture

This project implements the U-Net architecture, a specialized convolutional neural network designed for biomedical image segmentation.

### Key Features

- **U-shaped design**: The network consists of a contracting path (encoder) and an expansive path (decoder), forming a distinctive U-shape
- **Contracting path**: Captures context through a series of convolutions and max pooling operations
- **Expansive path**: Performs upsampling of feature maps and combines them with high-resolution features
- **Skip connections**: Direct connections between corresponding layers that preserve spatial information
- **Symmetric architecture**: The expansive path mirrors the contracting path

U-Net's design effectively addresses the fundamental trade-off between localization accuracy and contextual understanding that existed in previous fully convolutional networks.

## Dataset

This project utilizes the **Kvasir-SEG dataset**, a comprehensive collection of gastrointestinal polyp images with corresponding segmentation masks.

### Dataset Specifications

- **Content**: 1,000 polyp images with corresponding ground truth segmentation masks
- **Source**: Collected during real colonoscopy examinations
- **Format**:
  - Images: High-resolution RGB images in JPG format
  - Segmentation Masks: Binary masks in PNG format
- **Resolution**: Variable, predominantly 720×576 pixels
- **Annotations**: Pixel-level annotations by medical experts, verified by experienced endoscopists

## Evaluation Metrics

### Dice Coefficient (DICE)
- **Definition**: Measures overlap between two segmentation masks
- **Formula**: DICE = 2|A∩B|/(|A|+|B|) = 2TP/(2TP+FP+FN)
- **Range**: [0,1] where 1 indicates perfect overlap
- **Use case**: Commonly used in medical image segmentation; more sensitive to true positives

### Intersection over Union (IoU)
- **Definition**: Measures overlap divided by union of two segmentation masks
- **Formula**: IoU = |A∩B|/|A∪B| = TP/(TP+FP+FN)
- **Range**: [0,1] where 1 indicates perfect overlap
- **Use case**: Standard in computer vision benchmarks; more strictly penalizes errors

  Project is not yet completed. Further documentation will be provided upon completion of the project.
